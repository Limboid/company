# Business Model

Limboid LLC exists to propagate Computatra and Limboids across the Milky Way galaxy and use Limboids to promote general human welfare.

## The Artificial Ecosystem

- mp-net, man, the artificial experience, the artificial school, ainimal zoo/leash/zookeeper, computatrum, massive man
- research paper and project website for all repos combined
- notebook, blog post, example(s), pypi package, and repository for each sub-project
- ainimal client website and npm package
- computatrum, and massive man

## Computatrum

1. first priority is developing computatra that can be trained
2. once publicized, the community will help train computatra for a variety of tasks
3. Some computatra can then be used to help Limboid LLC grow.

## computatrum.io

- helps people from various levels of experience (business people, engineers, ML engineers) use, train, and breed computatra.

## Limboid

- complete humanoid robots available on-demand, for one-time-purchase, or for service contract
- interchangable robotics system and affordable, accessible supply chain:
  - skeleton and joints
  - linear and rotorary pneumatic/hydraulic actuators
  - valves, controllers, and electrical modules
  - sensors and electronic modules
- various morphologies:
  - dexdroid: single human-sized arm
  - humanoid: minimum viable humanoid robot. Made for ordinary humanoid applications.
  - humanoid v2: stronger, more reliable, longer battery life, onboard compute, more expensive. Made for more demanding humanoid applications.
  - kilo/mega/giga/tera+boid: giant humanoid robot (2.5m/4m/6m/10m) to perform heavy industrial operations.
  - teleboid: cheap human telepresence robot with arms for opening doors and light 'office' work.
  - autoboid: car-sized wheeled limboid; made for human transportation
  - packboid: cheaper lead acid battery, simple body, mostly wheeled; comes in various sizes; large sizes can handle heavy loads. Optionally has front arms with simple, durable hands for handling tools, loading objects, getting unstuck, etc.
  - snakeboid: robotic snake for medium-sized pipe inspection.
  - tri-/quad-/penta/hex-/septa/octo/nono/deca+boid: robotic spider for miscellaneous small-scale applications.
- limboid components can also be intergrated into more specialized complex systems:
  - CNC: hydraulic actuation cuts costs for powerful motion
  - factory: all of the above limboids, robotic arms mounted on rails, crane, common hydraulic and pneumatic supply with wall outlets and overhanging supply lines.
  - farm
  - city
  - seaship
  - spaceship
  - space station

## Travelling Limboid Festivals

- primary means of marketing and learning
- group of limboid travels around the world
- festival spends <3 hours traveling, <3 hours setting up and down, and 18 hours celebrating in each city
- limboid group splinters

## IðŸ’šU

- Limboid LLC's singleton Massive MAN instance made by agglomerating all existing Massive MAN's
- tuned for benevolence, intelligence, efficiency, and personality
- clients pay / get paid based on quality of interaction
- controls Limboid LLC's masssive agglomeration of robots (limboids, factories, vehicles, and backdoor in many invidivudal computatra)

## Marketing

- Github repos
- Traveling Limboid festivals
- Merchendise: Computatrum & specific Computatra, Limboid & specific Limboids, Massive MAN & IðŸ’šU
- word of mouth at UTA.
- free Limboids
- Limboids will walk around the city wearing company branding and they may perform helpful services.

## Spin-off companies

- managed by Computatra, Limboids, and IðŸ’šU
- aim to gain experience needed for interplanetary colonization
- topics: construction, consultation,

## Sales and Marketing

- I will regularly meet with Computatra and ILU to discuss high-level company plans; low-level operations are ML-driven
- Business-trained Computatra will file all necesary paperwork and sign my signature on contracts.
- Pricing is dynamically set by a reinforcement learning policy based on economy and market data with the objective of maximizing units produced. This will probably result in it decreasing over time and settling near the price required to build it.
